# MINI-MAX-SUM
The program Mini-Max-Sum takes a list of integers, computes the smallest and largest possible sums from any four out of five elements, and displays the results. The miniMaxSum function achieves this by sorting the list, adding the lowest four numbers for the minimum sum, and the highest four numbers for the maximum sum.
